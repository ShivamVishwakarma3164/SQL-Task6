# SQL-Task6
Objective:
In this task, I practiced using different types of subqueries in SQL. I worked with scalar subqueries, correlated subqueries, and subqueries using IN, EXISTS, and =. The goal was to learn how to filter and compare data using nested queries.

What I Did:
Used scalar subqueries that return a single value

Used correlated subqueries that refer to the outer query

Used subqueries with IN, EXISTS, and = for filtering

Applied subqueries inside WHERE and SELECT clauses

Queries I Used:
Find the book with the earliest publication year
→ Used scalar subquery with =

Find all books written by authors who have written at least 2 books
→ Used nested subquery with IN

List members who have borrowed more than 1 book
→ Used correlated subquery with COUNT()

Find members who have borrowed at least one book
→ Used EXISTS in a correlated subquery

Show all books with the average publication year included
→ Used scalar subquery inside the SELECT statement

Result:
From this task, I learned how subqueries can be used in different ways to add conditions, compare data, and build more powerful queries. I now understand how to use scalar and correlated subqueries effectively and how to apply IN, EXISTS, and = with subqueries in real-world SQL queries.
